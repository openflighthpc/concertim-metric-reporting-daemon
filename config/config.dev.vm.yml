# Configuration for generating the data source map lookup.
dsm:
  # The type of retriever to use for obtaining the data source map look up

  # If "file", "path" should be set to the path to a JSON file.  See
  # ./testdata/dsm.json for an example.
  #
  # If "script" it should be set to the path of an executable script that
  # prints JSON to stdout in the same format as above.  "args" can be set to an
  # array of arguments passed to the executable.
  #
  # Use these values when running on a dev concertim appliance.

  # The data source map is periodically updated using the configured retriever.
  # `frequency` specifies the frequency of the periodic updating.
  #
  # Certain events can cause the data source map to update outside of its
  # periodic updating.  To prevent over consumption of resources, the updates
  # can be throttled such that no two updates will occur within `throttle` of
  # each other.
  #
  # Both the `frequency` and `throttle` values require a number and unit, e.g.,
  # `60s` for sixty seconds or `1h10m20s` for one hour ten minutes and twenty
  # seconds.

  # Valid time units are “ns”, “us” (or “µs”), “ms”, “s”, “m”, “h”.

  # Estimate of how long it takes for the updater to run.
  #
  # If the DSM needs updating outside of its periodic updating, (for instance
  # when receiving a request to report a metric), the updating goroutine sleeps
  # for this duration and assumes that the update will have completed in that
  # duration.
  #
  # This adds a delay of `duration` to API calls to report a metric when the
  # host is not yet known.
  #
  # If this values is too small, it may temporarily result in metrics being
  # incorrectly rejected due to an unknown host.  Those metrics will eventually
  # be accepted.
