  # Timeout for server to process a request.

  # Requires a number and unit, e.g., `60s` for sixty seconds or `1h10m20s` for
  # one hour ten minutes and twenty seconds.
  # Valid time units are “ns”, “us” (or “µs”), “ms”, “s”, “m”, “h”.

  # The time in seconds that a host should remain "fresh" for.

  # included in the metric stream.

# Configuration for generating the data source map lookup.
dsm:
  # The data source map is periodically updated from the Concertim
  # Visualisation App. `frequency` specifies the frequency of the periodic
  # updating.
  #
  # Certain events can cause the data source map to update outside of its
  # periodic updating.  To prevent over consumption of resources, the updates
  # can be throttled such that no two updates will occur within `throttle` of
  # each other.
  #
  # Both the `frequency` and `throttle` values require a number and unit, e.g.,
  # `60s` for sixty seconds or `1h10m20s` for one hour ten minutes and twenty
  # seconds.
  #
  # Valid time units are “ns”, “us” (or “µs”), “ms”, “s”, “m”, “h”.
  frequency: 30s
  throttle: 5s

  # Estimate of how long it takes for the updater to run.
  #
  # If the DSM needs updating outside of its periodic updating, (for instance
  # when receiving a request to report a metric), the updating goroutine sleeps
  # for this duration and assumes that the update will have completed in that
  # duration.
  #
  # This adds a delay of `duration` to API calls to report a metric when the
  # host is not yet known.
  #
  # If this values is too small, it may temporarily result in metrics being
  # incorrectly rejected due to an unknown host.  Those metrics will eventually
  # be accepted.
  duration: 75ms

# Configuration for retrieving metrics from gmetad.
retrieval:
  # The IP address, or hostname, of the gmetad server to poll for metrics.

  # The metrics are periodically retrieved from the gmetad source. `frequency`
  # specifies the frequency of the periodic updating.
  #
  # Certain events can cause the metrics to be retrieved outside of its
  # periodic updating.  To prevent over consumption of resources, the updates
  # can be throttled such that no two updates will occur within `throttle` of
  # each other.
  #
  # Both the `frequency` and `throttle` values require a number and unit, e.g.,
  # `60s` for sixty seconds or `1h10m20s` for one hour ten minutes and twenty
  # seconds.
  #
  # Valid time units are “ns”, “us” (or “µs”), “ms”, “s”, “m”, “h”.

  # After gmetad has requested metrics from us, we request metrics from gmetad.
  # This value configures the delay between the two.  We want to provide enough

  # long as we want the metrics to be available to IRV as soon as possible.
