# Setting the debug_level above zero will make gmetad output
# debugging information and stay in the foreground
# default: 0
# debug_level 10
#
# The data_source tag must immediately be followed by a unique
# string which identifies the source then a list of machines
# which service the data source in the format ip:port, or name:port.
# If a # port is not specified then 8649 (the default gmond port) is
# assumed.
# default: There is no default value

# standard ganglia stream
# Currently disabled.  If we wish to re-enable it care should be taken to
# ensure that its metrics are not processed by ct-metric-reporting-daemon.
# Perhaps adding it to a different "localcluster" cluster would be sufficient.
# data_source "gmond" localhost

# User-defined metric injection daemon
data_source "ct-metric-reporting-daemon" localhost:8678

# List of machines this gmetad will share XML with
# default: There is no default value
trusted_hosts 127.0.0.1
#
# If you don't want gmetad to setuid then set this to off
# default: on
# setuid off
#
# User gmetad will setuid to (defaults to "nobody")
# default: "nobody"
setuid_username "ganglia"
#
# The port gmetad will answer requests for XML
# default: 8651
# xml_port 8651
#
# The number of threads answering XML requests
# default: 2
# server_threads 4
#
# Where gmetad stores its round-robin databases
# default: "/var/lib/ganglia/rrds"
# rrd_rootdir "/some/other/place"

# Metrics are reported every 15 seconds.  The archives are:
#  * One hour without consolidation.
#  * One day consolidating MIN, MAX and AVERAGE of 5 minutes.
#  * 90 days consolidating MIN, MAX and AVERAGE of one hour.
